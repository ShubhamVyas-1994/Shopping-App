# shopping_app

A new Flutter project.
This project includes =>
  1. Login Screen.
  2. Signup Screen.
  3. Category List.
  4. Item List.
  5. Splash screen.
  
Well to be honest many things can be done with UI but structure of the app matters. So keeping this in mind this project focuses on "STRUCTURE" but I don't like Keeping all logic related files in one folder so here i have divided it according to screens. Nothing new With UX here nor it have Awesome features.

=> It focuses using "RXDART" BehaviorSubject for forms.
=> Generating Routes and passing data through them.
=> Simple splash screen ('I have used an image here, you can be creative").
=> Grid view of category list.
=> List view of items in that category.
